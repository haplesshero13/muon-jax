# Muon-JAX: A port of the KellerJordan PyTorch optimizer to JAX

## Installation

TODO.

This package is just a demo for now. If you want to use it, simply copy in the code from muon.py and optax_muon.py if you use optax, and include it in your project. And make sure you install `jax>=0.6`, and optax if you use that.

## Usage

See the `test/` package and `main.py` for usage examples.
